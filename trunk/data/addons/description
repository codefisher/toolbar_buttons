Opens the Add-ons window to perform tasks on your installed Extensions, Themes, Plug-ins and Language packs.

This being the most downloaded button I have made speaks for itself.  The Add-on's window allows the installation and management of all your extensions and themes.  If you need an update, change a setting, swap themes or enable/disable an add-on the Add-ons' window is the place to go.  Being able to access this quickly is a necessity for anyone that uses even a handful of add-ons.
